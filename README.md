Program parameters are stored in environment variables:
- `VANILLA_EXT_EXE` - name of the executable file from which the assets will be extracted. The executable file must be in the same directory as the extractor, or in the current working directory. The default is **"Doukutsu.exe"**.
- `VANILLA_EXT_OUTDIR` - the path to the data directory where data will be extracted from the executable file. The default is **"data"**.

## Licensing
Almost all of the code is taken from [doukutsu-rs](https://github.com/doukutsu-rs/doukutsu-rs), so this program is licensed under the same licence: 
a modified MIT licence that forbids redistribution of this application bundled with data files taken from any commercial port released by Nicalis Inc. without their explicit permission.
