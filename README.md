Program parameters are stored in environment variables:
- `VANILLA_EXT_EXE` - name of the executable file from which the assets will be extracted. The executable file must be in the same directory as the extractor, or in the current working directory. The default is **"Doukutsu.exe"**.
- `VANILLA_EXT_OUTDIR` - the path to the data directory where data will be extracted from the executable file. The default is **"data"**.
